    "I hypothesized that certain characters might say things more fancily or in a more flowery way than other characters. I'm using the python library textstat to calculate the Flesch-Kinkaid Reading Ease rating for a particular PlayerLine. This rates a given text on a scale of 1-121.22, with higher scores meaning the text is less difficult to read, and lower scores meaning the text is more difficult to read. This might allow for a classifier to be more accurate, as scores might tend to cluster differently depending on the character speaking the line."
